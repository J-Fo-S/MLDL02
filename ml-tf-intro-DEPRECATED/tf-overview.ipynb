    "Now that we've gotten our hands dirty with Python and some of its important operations, it's time to take on Tensorflow. Tensorflow is Google's language platform for deep learning, and it is one - if not the - most important platforms for deep learning available to the public. It can be used on its own or through higher-level frameworks such as Caffe and Keras, which can be set to use Tensorflow as a backend. \n",

    "### Foreword - Take a Deep Breath..\n",
    "\n",
    "Fear not, but Tensorflow is extraordinarily complex and can be quite complicated - almost too so. It has layers upon layers of abstractions and a horde of APIs which seem to gain and fall from prominence each day. Backwards compatibility is often an issue. Such is the life of a rapidly developin ecosystem I suppose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the above, we will come across very many methods of writing Tensorflow programs as we explore some of the most interesting models currently available. It is COMPLETELY NORMAL to feel overwhelmed and confused at first. Do not worry about this. Our method in this course is not to try and understand everything at once, but focus on areas of interest to understand how they work and how we may work with them. We will expand our knowledge in this fashion, by combining what we learn. In time, the whole picture of Tensorflow and machine/deep learning will become clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level / Low-Level\n",
    "\n",
    "One can create the same model in 30 lines of code or in hundreds of lines. We are going to do both. Why? Well, the 30-line model is so *high-level* that we won't really understand what those 30 lines of code are doing, for everything is hidden in high-level abstractions. So we can look at lower-level code, which will have many more lines but show us more clearly what exactly is happening. Once we understand how the model works on a lower-level, we can work more knowledgeably and quickly with higher-level programming again.\n"

    "### Tensorflow and Python - BFFs Forever?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow works hand-in-hand with the Python framework and many of its methods are basically exact replicas of Python/Numpy code. This is generally a good thing because it gives us familiarity as we work between the two languages. The reason for this partnership is that their similarities and compatibility support a fundamental difference in execution: **immediate/eager evaluation** vs. **graph computation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Python will evaluate (run) the code as soon as it sees it. Tensorflow, on the other hand, does not immediately run its operations. Instead, it builds a so-called *graph*, which can be considered like a system of how each variable and operation are connected to one another. In order to execute (run) the graph, we must explicitly tell Tensorflow to do so. This will become apparent in the example code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final note - this introductory code has been taken from several sources, who often do a better job explaining then I can, so we will follow along with some external sites as we go. To start with, please open [this tutorial](https://jacobbuckman.com/post/tensorflow-the-confusing-parts-1/#understanding-tensorflow) to read along with the example code below."
